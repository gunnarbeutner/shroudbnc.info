    <p>shroudBNC is a modular IRC proxy written in C++. It is capable of proxying IRC connections for multiple users. Using TCL scripts it can be extended.</p>

    <p>Among its features you can find a user-friendly web interface (written in TCL and PHP) which allows you to easily create and manage your users. Some <a href="/files/screenshots">screenshots</a> are also available.</p>

    <p>A variety of operating systems are currently supported: Linux and FreeBSD (and possibly other variations of BSD).</p>
